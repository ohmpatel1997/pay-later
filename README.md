# pay-later

Pay Later is a POC application for leading fintech company Simpl (https://getsimpl.com/), which enables users to make transactions with partnered merchants immediately and users can pay later on a monthly basis based on their billing.
The idea behind this project is to model the architecture, designing the database models and microservices. The project is entirely built using Golang.
